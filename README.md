This project is a MERN stack application for the HEB Developer 2 test. It uses the mlab mongo DB but can use any DB if given the connection strings.

# Installation
After copying the repo, do the following:
1. ``` npm install```
2. ``` npm start ```

The DB connection strings are in the config.js file. if you are changing to a new DB location you should add the data again to the db by doing: ``` node setup/mongoSetup.js ```
